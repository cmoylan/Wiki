= Python Closures =

== Introduction ==
Same as Javascript closures, for the most part. Allow you to bind external
variables to a function so that the only access to those variables is through
the function.


== Syntax ==
{{{class="brush: python" >
def make_counter():
    i = 0
    def counter(): # counter() is a closure
        nonlocal i
        i += 1
        return i
    return counter

c1 = make_counter()
c2 = make_counter()

print (c1(), c1(), c2(), c2())
# -> 1 2 1 2
}}}
